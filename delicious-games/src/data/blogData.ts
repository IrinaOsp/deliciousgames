      `I feel like I’ve been designing Messina 1347 my entire life, at least since that day in the 80s when my mum (or my grandma, I can't quite remember) gave me <i>“La Ruta del Tesoro,”</i> one of my first ever board games. It was like Monopoly but based in the Mediterranean during medieval times and published by Cefa. I changed the rules so that my sister and brothers wouldn’t get bored, and I remember imagining fleets of ships sailing the sea from Constantinople to Sicily, carrying all sorts of goods and treasures./n

Later on, when I was studying computer engineering, I tried to convert all my ideas into a videogame called <i>“Mare Nostrum.”</i> When I swapped computing for history of art, I abandoned the idea of the game, but years later I became aware that the game had never abandoned me. One day in 2016, I thought it was about time for me to take another look but this time there was an ingredient that I really wanted to add to the mix: the Black Death. So I started to work seriously on developing a game set in 1347-1348, when the Black Death arrived in Europe via the Mediterranean./n

My first idea involved using a map of the Mediterranean as the board, with the same cities as <i>“La Ruta del Tesoro,”</i> and the mechanic had the boats sailing round the map, just like the pieces move around the board in Monopoly. I rejected that mechanic. Coincidentally, I was playing Maracaibo recently when I suddenly thought: “Hey, that was my initial idea for <b>La Peste Negra!</b> It would have worked!” When that initial design became stuck in a dead end, I then thought about basing the game in a single city: Messina. After all, that was the first city where plague-infected merchants would disembark. I designed a city with square tiles, forming a board which would change every game, and this idea was quite similar to the end product. Each tile gave you resources or actions, you progressed with influence points and victory points, and infected tiles would lead to penalties if you didn’t clear out the plague first.`,
      `That game, which was a simple eurogame but one with a strong theme, won the <b>Zona Lúdica</b> prototypes competition in 2017 and showed me that I must have been doing something right. It went on to win various other competitions and games conventions and people seemed to really like it. Even though a few publishing contracts fell through, the game was selected for ProtoLab 2018 in Cannes, where a couple of other publishers (one French and one Russian) took an interest. However, I found myself at a dead end once again and had to come up with something new.`,
      `I changed the square tiles for hexagonal ones, this time forming a fixed board (Vladimir would later change it back to a modular board) and introduced one of the most successful mechanics: the player board with double tracks, on which you have to choose which way to go at a given point and your chosen track ends up fusing with the adjacent resource track. That was one of the things that Vladimir liked the most and therefore kept (and improved). This new version won second prize for prototypes at the <b>2019 JugarxJugar</b> convention in Granollers and first prize in the 2019 Malaga Board Game Convention. The latter was a key moment for Messina 1347: one of the judges of the competition was Vladimir Suchý, who approached me to say that he was really interested in the game and that there was a chance it could be published.`,
      `I sent him a prototype and we began to exchange information about the game via email. He suggested some changes in the core mechanics and that we publish it as co-authors through Delicious Games, his publishing company. I accepted and ever since then, each of us has been testing it separately and meeting up on Tabletopia to test it together. Little by little, we have been polishing all aspects of the game and you’ll be able to see the results very soon at Essen 2021. I’m sure it will be worth all the hard work we’ve put in during all the different stages of Messina 1347.<br/><br/><b><i>Raúl Fernández Aparicio</i></b>`,

      `At the end of 2019 my wife and I were invited to attend the Málaga Board Games Convention (BGC). The organizers were so kind to us, and the place itself was wonderful, and in addition they asked whether I would be a member of the committee judging a prototype competition they were running. I was honored to accept./n

Because I am primarily a player of Eurogames and am also someone who is interested in games that have a historical angle, I was especially interested in a competition entry called <b>Messina 1347</b> — a game about the arrival and spread of the Black Plague to Europe via <b>Messina</b> in Sicily in 1347. This prototype included some interesting ideas that I'd not often seen in games before. It was, at its heart, a worker-driven game, but it also had a mechanism for spreading infection throughout the city. I also found it interesting how the board state within the game evolved; it simultaneously functioned as the place for the workers to take their actions, but was also where the plague spread, which in turn affected where you might send your workers. I also found the player boards interesting as they used the three different types of citizens in the game on different tracks./n

The game at that time — as with any other prototype (mine included!) — wasn't so well balanced in my opinion. I held some discussions with the designer, Raúl Fernández Aparicio, and I told him some of my ideas based on that prototype and suggested how the game could perhaps become better balanced./n

After those discussions, Raúl agreed to make some adjustments to the prototype, incorporating some of my suggestions, and then to send it to on us at Delicious Games, our company, to be further tested. In the spring of 2020, just as life was beginning to imitate art and a real world pandemic was kicking in with Covid-19, Raúl sent us his updated <b>Messina</b> prototype./n

The game had been updated with some of my suggestions but it still had some balance issues. At this stage, we thought hard about what we should do next. The prototype definitely contained good ideas, and we believed they could be the basis for an interesting Eurogame. However, at the same time, we were of the opinion that the prototype was not in a state where it could be tested fully or was close to publication. The game, as it existed then, also had a lower complexity weight than other games published by us here at Delicious Games./n

From a personal point of view, I was interested in collaborating with another designer to design a game. I have worked on more than ten published designs with myself as the designer, but I had never worked with another designer on a game, and it was something I knew I wanted to try at some point in my design career. I suggested this to Raúl and said that if he agreed, I would try to redesign the prototype and that we would become co-designers on the project. Raúl agreed to proceed on that basis, which was great news./n

At that time, we, as Delicious Games, did not make an offer to publish the game because we didn't yet know how the game would go down with playtesters after its redesign. Testing with experienced players is a very important factor for us in determining whether we think a game we have as a prototype could eventually be published or not. We did, however, want to keep the theme of the game and most of the interesting mechanisms as we were sure they would provided the basis for a solid Eurogame./n

During the next few months, while I was finishing my own design of Praga Caput Regni, I reworked the prototype for <b>Messina</b>, leaving in what I thought were the most interesting aspects of it./n

First, I adjusted the theme of the game so that the gameplay had more of a thematic arc. At the beginning of the game the plague arrives in the city and starts to spread. After a while, it becomes rampant in the city, requiring the players to help fight the plague. After a while, though, it is controlled to a degree and starts to decline to the point where it is possible for citizens to return to the city. This arc, which I tried to replicate through the use of certain mechanisms within the game, hopefully adds layers to the theme of the game and echoes what happened in <b>Messina</b> at the time the game is set./n

Originally the game had a board with hexes on it. I wanted to still use hexes, but decided to change the board so that they were individual hexes rather than being pre-printed on a board. This allowed for greater variability as well as the ability to adjust the size of the ‟city" to better match the number of players. Because I like variability in games a lot and consider it an important element of my designs, I added a mechanism in which citizen tokens were randomly placed in different locations each round. It is this aspect together with the variable introduction of plague cubes on those hexes that makes it, in my opinion, an interesting choice as to whether to use a hex for its action or not and also whether to help rescue a particular citizen or not./n

Adding citizens to the main board, now divided into individual hexes, was also the basis for the next mechanism in the game. I expanded the idea of the player board into the shape of a country farmhouse where the citizens who had escaped the city could flee to./n

These citizens could then take additional actions at the farmhouse, based on their type, which increased your incentive to take them in the first place. I tried to further enhance the integration of theme and mechanisms here by adding the need to quarantine those citizens who arrived at the farmhouse infected with the plague, which added complexity to the choices of which citizens to bring back to the players' farmhouses and when./n

I also redesigned the three tracks on the player boards so that they were more integrated into the game./n

Finally, I also introduced the idea of the ships coming into the city. Not only do they bring citizens and goods with them; they also bring the plague itself. This was another attempt to tie the theme of the game to the historical setting.`,
      `Through these changes, the game increased in complexity and formed the basis of the game that we decided to publish./n

Even though the time of the Covid pandemic could be seen in a positive light for designers who had more time to spend on designing games by themselves in their homes, it was not a good thing for testing prototypes. In the autumn of 2020, we had to decide how we were going to playtest <b>Messina</b>, especially now that it had become a more complex prototype than what it started out as./n

The decision on whether to take it further or not was strongly influenced by the overall situation with Covid. I did initial testing on the new prototype, and I got it to a point that I was happy with. However, there was still a lot of to do on <b>Messina</b>, and now we wanted to put the prototype in front of more groups of different players to find out whether we could publish as it was or whether we needed to redesign anything./n

At this point, though, the Czech Republic was under a strict lockdown throughout the whole autumn, and it was very difficult to test this design with other players. We put together an electronic version of the game, but we increasingly found that online testing was not suitable for us to tell whether players liked it or not; when you play online, you can't always see the reaction of the players or tell how many issues are caused by the interface rather than the game itself./n

Another problem we grappled with at this time was the theme of the game. In 2019, when we first discussed publishing the game, the idea of a worldwide pandemic was more like something from a science fiction story or something firmly from the annals of history. But now, we had to consider trying to publish a game about fighting an epidemic at the time the world was experiencing one for real./n

The final decision about whether we should publish <b>Messina</b> was done after we carefully considered the reaction of playtesters to the theme. We asked people what they thought about the theme, and the answer was mostly the same — that they didn't mind the plague epidemic theme, but that some people may not like it as it may be "too close to home" for them. However, we never actually came across anyone who said that they didn't want to try the game because Covid was around and because of any modern parallels with the game./n

In fact, our ultimate decision to publish <b>Messina</b> was our way of showing that while Covid had affected so many facets of our daily lives up that point that we wouldn't be limited or held back by it any more.`,
      `So we decided to publish <b>Messina</b> for SPIEL '21. After that, we undertook extensive playtesting of the game, as did Raúl. We both had different groups of players who playtested the game a lot. We struggled through a lockdown at the beginning of this phase during which time we also tested the game as much as we could online and by playing the game solo. Thankfully, after a while, the situation with Covid improved and lockdown restrictions were not so limiting and finally we could meet players face-to-face to fully playtest the game./n

The biggest challenge for us was to balance the game fully. In games of this type where you can gain more workers, it is important that it doesn't turn into a race to get the next worker as this can negatively impact on the possibility for players to try out other strategies. We wanted to ensure that we avoided this potentially dominant ‟snowball effect". After a number of adjustments, I think we managed to avoid this problem well, and I believe that <b>Messina</b> still has a lot of variability that gives players various viable strategies to explore and different ways to win./n

To be even more variable, I also suggested that the player boards have double sides with asymmetric farms on the opposing sides and also that the scroll boards have alternate sides that provide different scoring opportunities, both of which provide an even more advanced challenge./n

In the end, I think we here at Delicious Games, together with Raúl, have produced another fascinating Eurogame that has a complexity level similar to <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247763/underwater-cities" target="_blank">Underwater Cities</a> Underwater Cities or Praga Caput Regni and which combines engine-building mechanisms with wide variability and provides many different strategies to explore./n

From a personal game designer point of view, I was able to experience co-designing a game for the first time by helping to further develop a pre-existing game made by someone else. The result is a design in which contributions from both designers were very important both at the start of design and also during its development and its finalization. Our two different approaches helped to create a new game, which is heavily influenced by both designers.`,
      `Finally, the theme of the game can remind us that in the past, pandemics were more dangerous and less predictable or manageable than now. Vaccines didn't exist, and even when they were invented, they couldn't be developed or produced as quickly as they can now. I think we can all agree that as bad as the Covid pandemic has been, we should be grateful that we weren't around at the time of the ‟Black Plague" when it spread around Europe and Asia and killed a third of those that it infected./n

That shouldn't take away from the fact that the current pandemic has undoubtedly led to the untimely deaths of a lot people as well as caused hardship of many kinds all round the world. <b>Consequently we decided, following a suggestion from our fans and due to the special situation we are all in, to donate part of the profit from every copy of Messina 1347 sold to the international humanitarian organization <a href="https://www.msf.org/" target="_blank">"Médicins Sans Frontières".</a></b><br/>

      `From the my designer’s view, „Praga“ is a second game, where the <i>THEME</i> was the first thing I was thinking about……./n

What was at the start of thinking about Prague as the main element of my new game? Maybe it was walking around Prague center a lot of years ago with my friend during my student‘s time. I was born here in this very nice city and wanted to know most of the historical sights more or even less known. I recognized that thanks to unique panoramas of Charles Bridge and Prague Castle is Prague one of the most beautiful cities in the world. These walks and „absorption“ of historical datas about Prague gave me unforgetable memories and experiences./n

During following time I was overhelmed by a lot of ordinary family and working joys and worries, walks decreased, but thoughts about our city didn’t leave me J I was interested in reading a lot of books about historical Prague./n

When I was designing my first games, I also included <i>HISTORY</i> to the producing process. You can notice it in my first published game <i>League of Six</i>. Despite of the fact, I always thought about czech history as a main theme of my game, Prague was still waiting for its chance…../n

After finishing Underwater Cities and its expansion I was founding new themes for my next game. Historical theme - my favourite - was waiting and suddenly I consider that now is the right time to fulfill one of my dreams and design strategical EURO about building my hometown – Royal City of Prague./n

In my head there was growing the thought about designing the game in which the main goal will be to build up medieval city during the period of reign of Emperor Charles IV. (1313 – 1378 a.d.). I longed primarily real historical sights and buildings – Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, Charles University etc…., which we could visit and admire till now, to be in my game./n

<h3><b>Mechanics</b></h3>/n
Next step was constructing of suitable mechanics which would include as many realities of Prague and events from Charles IV. period as possible. It is obvious that in big EURO this condition will be a result of more or less compromises. In the moment I am writing these letters, the game is already nearly finished and only some corrections of small disbalances in mechanics are done. When I am looking at historical sights now, I am saying to myself….“…why didn’t I put this square on the main board?...why this church is not included in it?...“ But finally I mean that in the game there is quite enough interesting Prague sights./n

During the designing proces, I was afraid about connecting the theme and more complex mechanics….I was asking myself….“…would it be possible to bound all together – nice but not simple mechanics and beautiful building theme?...“/n

The theme includes one of the most famous period of Prague and Czech Kingdom history. In the first half of 14th century the throne was ascended by young and able Luxembourg Charles IV. One of the first steps he did was building up „New Prague City“. Thanks to this Prague – residence of Czech King and Roman Emperor – was one of the 10 largest Cities in Europe. Except of „New Prague City“, there was built also famous Charles Bridge, St. Vitus Cathedral and buildings connected to just founded University./n

This historical range provided to me during designing proces a lot of possibilities when the theme could be maintained./n

The main goal of the game is building. At the start of the whole process I tried to maintain parts and mechanics, which corresponded with this historical period. You could notice it by looking at the main board where „Old Prague City“ and „New Prague City“ are divided by King’s road. Players also build up City walls, St. Vitus Cathedral and Charles Bridge./n

The choosing the action is the main mechanic of the game. (Players are gaining resources helping them to build a Cathedral, Bridge, City and Walls and improving their actions)./n

During the „modelling“ of particular turns in my head I tried to connect mechanics as much as possible. It was realised by the central mechanic of choosing the actions. My main goal was to make players to choose from different actions and not to focus on one of them and play it the whole time….I thought about it the way that when player chooses some strategy, he has to play it consequently with other mechanics to be succesful. Despite of the fact that the game now seems to be complex and particular mechanics are connected together logically, keeping in my head of playing actions by moving player’s cubes on 3D historical buildings and other processes was the most demanding challenge I ever experienced during designing of my games./n

Regarding to the fact, that I like using dices in my games a lot, they were main element of Praga in the first phase of creating the game. Players should throw 3 dices to choose from particular actions and following bonuses./n

But after first testing at home with my family I figured out that this is not the best choice of mechanic…I tried to adjust process to be usable and enjoyable enough with dices but it didn’t work. The mechanic was too random to do strategical decisions in this game. It was not good here./n

I was faced with a new designer’s experience. In my previous games I’ve determined the main mechanic and then I’ve built other mechanics around it. Central mechanism was sometimes a little bit adjusted to other mechanics but the main principle stayed the same. But now I found out that the Central mechanism doesn’t work!!/n

I was forced to proceed the way that the secondary thematical mechanics I left the same and the central mechanism was completely changed. I used the one I thought about years ago while designing any other game. It was using the wheel in which tiles with two actions are inserted. On this wheel there are bonuses and there was also possibility to gain more bonuses by taking not so much favourite action tiles….and obligation of paying more resources for taking the best tiles…..players could choose from 2 actions on 1 tile…./n

This mechanic I adjusted technically to the strategical possibilities of Praga and it finally turned out to be the most suitable central mechanism for this game. From the designer’s point of view I was able to manage this really difficult situation - the need to change the central mechanism – without any major changes of secondary mechanics.`,

      `As we said in Editorial, we decided to public constantly Underwater Cities producing process and its development.  Reason for this is that we would like to promote it as a future product naturally and at the same time we want to show our fans what should we manage during production of Eurogame. Next reason is that we hope you will help us with solving our dilemas and problems in some aspects of the game.  We really appreciate help of our boardgame fans  so our idea is to choose before Spiel´18 in Essen  the most active contributors  from which we allot three who will get a free copy of Underwater Cities.`,
      `Question 1 – How should we illustrate sea bottom ?? Wonderful sea from Dreamland or not??:`,
      `Theme of our game takes place in future and players are project managers  for building underwater areas, where could live part of our population. Every player has his own plan of underwater area, which presents sea bottom.  On this plan players build domes (cities), tunnels and devices as laboratories, desalination plants and farms.`,
      `The question is….How to illustrate this underwater bottom…?`,
      `First idea was: We let to illustrate water, there will be some waves, fish and nice blue sea.`,
      `First  illustrator´s comment: OK, but players will build their cities right on the sea surface, it could look strange.`,
      `Our idea: So we could illustrate seabed, we build cities right on the sea bottom, we could illustrate there also some beautiful colourful corals, fish, seahorses and other beautiful  „sea-stuff“.`,
      `Then another comment: Domes which are built by players are so big, if we would like to keep size ratio of all the things there, corals and seahorses can´t be visible enough because of its real size.`,
      `Comment of Ecologist: We can´t build domes on preserved corals!`,
      `Idea:  Ok, we could try something like a map of seabed area taken as a photo from a high altitude – something like remote sensing picture. Seabed could be visible and players could build on the sea bottom.`,
      `Our great illustrator has made a sketch of underwater bottom.  We added contours for building device necessary for imaging how it all works together and can´t wait the moment we test  it with our friends.`,
      `Comments from next testing:`,
      `„Oops, why do you call it Underwater Cities and build domes on the Moon surface plan?“`,
      `Oh, yeah, it isn´t the right way of illustrating it…`,
      `Next ideas follow:`,
      `We can try to forgot a perspective a little bit and add some corals, it should look like a sea. In addition three corners of the underwater plan should be above sea level , there should be land and beach or some transition to the sea.`,
      `Dialog with the illustrator follows: If I illustrate it this way, we are building on the sea-surface again `,
      `Yep, we know, you are true.  So what can we do with that…..?  We can try view to the cities in the corners of the plan, transition to the water and the rest as a bottom with corals. However  we must accept that this is future underwater area in future World.  Why wouldn´t be possible the situation that project manager lies on a mat on the sea – surface with left eye above the sea level and look at the city and the right eye having  under sea level  and if it is possible also to hold his telescope. With this telescope he could see also corals around`,
      `When we accept this unreal  idea,  we illustrate very nice picture of underwater building area which will look as a sea bottom and everything what belongs to it and not as a Moon surface picture.`,
      `We are adding 4 proposals of visual look of our underwater plans. We are interested in your opinion to these proposals. What do you think about possible unreal perspective of these pictures? Is it OK? And what about color of it?`,
